It felt a bit odd writing part of a Shakespearean quote in the title for this post, but alas, I feel like it works.

_To be, or not to be, that is the question?_

Rules around coding style and formatting are part of every codebase. Love them or hate them, they normally crop up some where. And if they don't, well, they will eventually.

Formatting rules are a bit different I guess - it's how the code is presented in the file. Should there be a maximum line width? Should semi-colons exist? (yes). Tabs? Spaces?

They're a little different to the stylistic rules you normally think of when you talk about coding style.

Nevertheless, different people have different preferences.

## Potential Future State

A colleague mentioned an interesting thought in the office the other day. It was along the lines of "code morphing to suit each individual's needs in their own development environment".

As you can guess, that doesn't exist at the moment. But it was a rather intriguing way to think about how formatting rules could work in the future.

How might it work? Well, each individual could define their own formatting config local to them, and the rules would be applied on their machine. Perhaps, when they push to a branch, the remote repo formats the code to a different set of standardized rules. And similarly, when pulling back down, code is re-formatted back into your preferences.

It doesn't sound like the most efficient way to deal with it, but it would get the job done.
